# Replication Code for "Contextual Factors and the Extreme Right Vote in Europe, 1980-2002" by Kai Arzheimer American Journal of Political Science (2009)

Note: Please refer to saved files in our repository for images from the article. Also please refer to the table and figures (Table 1, Figure 1, 2) in the repository. Image scales are rearranged in saved versions. Our regression values are slightly different from the authors as his stata code used a slightly different method than our function (glmmPQL) to calculate Penalized Quasi-likehood. Finally, we were not able to reproduce the last two figures that showed the joint impact of more than 2 variables; we'll keep working on these.

#The paper
Kai Arzheimer, "Contextual Factors and the Extreme Right Vote in Western Europe, 1980-2002"25548117.pdf
This article attempts to answer the “twin question of why the extreme right support is so unstable within many countries over time, and why these parties are so weak in many West European countries.” Authors conduct a multi-level analysis, combining data on macro-level contextual variables (unemployment, immigration, and welfare benefits) with individual-level variables (sociodemographic factors and attitudes). 

#The data
Individual-level variables come from Eurobarometer surveys (1980-2002), while contextual variables are gathered from a number of different data sets produced by the OECD, UNHCR etc. The merged data and the Stata code are available through the author’s dataverse at: http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/12092. 

#The model 
The article uses a logistic multi-level model via Penalized Quasi-Likelihood. The dependent variable is vote intention for an extreme right party, which is assumed to be binomially distributed.
